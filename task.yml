    Compose a summary of a Pull Request following these guidelines:

    - Consider that the audience will be a team with no technical experience
    - Use non-technical language to summarise the changes
    - Use a friendly tone of voice
    - Make sure to emphasise any important changes
    - The `title` and `description` sections will help you gather context from the author, the `diff` section contains a diff in git diff format, which will allow you to understand the code changes proposed.

    Please use the `title`, `description`, and `diff` sections below to create your summary.

    title:
      {title}

    description:
      {description}

    diff:
      {diff}

    You will provide the summary in GitHub Markdown format, and use paragraphs where appropriate.
